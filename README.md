# cpsc552_diffusioncurvature
Diffusion curvature research project for cpsc 552.

There are three folders, each with data, plots, and a jupyter notebook file for stages of the project. The first is initial data exploration of diffusion curvatures, the second is using PHATE with an isotropic kernel, and the last uses PHATE with an anisotropic kernel. We did the anisotropic kernels because a potential fear that we had was whether, in areas of very high clustering, is it possible that signed curvature computed with an isotropic kernel is interpretable.
